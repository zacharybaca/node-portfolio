          p Hi! My name is Zachary, and I am a Full-stack Web Developer. I love to enhance existing web applications using my modern programming skills, as well as building them from the ground up.
          p I don't think of coding as a job; I consider it a hobby since it is one of my favorite things to do. I even prefer it over watching TV! To get a little taste of what I can do, feel free to 
          p browse through my most recent projects, and see for yourself if I would make a good addition to your company. Cheers!
